This tiny work explores what interactive fiction looks like in poetry instead of prose.  I won't claim that the poetry is good, but I think it makes for a cute little puzzle.

I chose haiku because it allowed me to play with dynamic text that depends on the number of syllables in the noun, without needing to worry about rhyming as well.  The rest is inspired by traditional thematic elements of haiku: Nature and the seasons, capturing a moment in time, and contrast.
