I set out to create an IF work in poetry instead of prose, wanting to play with generated text.  Haiku was a good fit both because it's brief (working nicely into the call-and-response format) and because it eliminated the need to manage rhymes.  At that point I started reading up on themes in traditional Japanese haiku: Nature, the seasons, contrast of two ideas, capturing a fleeting moment or a particular impression.  Taking the 'moment' idea a step further (and not wanting to implement too much) led to the frozen time conceit, which I think locks down the inevitable goofiness of player agency and helps the piece feel more poetic.</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">line break</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">The goal of the game is to figure out what is going on.  Within the frozen moment the player is not allowed any action beyond examining their surroundings, but eventually I hope that they realize that time itself is an observable object, and the 'solution' of the game is to [</span><span class="substitution">bold type</span><span class="quote">]start time[</span><span class="substitution">roman type</span><span class="quote">] and usher in the spring.  No explicit comment is made on why the player has this power; it just felt right that the ultimate interaction with a moment is to move on to the next one.</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">line break</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">The game begins with this room description:</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">line break</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">line break</span><span class="quote">][</span><span class="substitution">bold type</span><span class="quote">]Glade[</span><span class="substitution">roman type</span><span class="quote">][</span><span class="substitution">line break</span><span class="quote">][</span><span class="substitution">the description of Glade</span><span class="quote">][</span><span class="substitution">line break</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">line break</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">The initial description hints three directions for observation:  First, the dirt path (the most obvious course of action) leads to rocks and snow on the ground, and represents the end of winter.  Second, the wood (implying trees) which will lead the player to explore aspects of spring.    Finally, the dew subtly points to the waterfall, where frozen time is more conspicuous and should hint the player toward the ending - starting time again and ushering in the spring.</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">line break</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">Thank you for playing!
